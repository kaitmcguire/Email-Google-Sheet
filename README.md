# Email-Google-Sheet
This is a Google Script that will email the email(s) you choose a chosen Google Sheet every day. I use it to email myself a spreadsheet of emails that land in a catchall account so I can skim them in the morning, and I use it to automate the emailing of reports. 
It is heavily based on [this](https://www.tillerhq.com/blog/2017/8/25/get-a-daily-email-summary-of-your-tiller-budget-dashboard), but is simplified to be usable with any email without excess code.
